Reading is a fundamental skill in language learning, and it can be especially challenging when dealing with entirely new scripts and foreign grammar structures. In this meeting, we'll be going over particles and their usage in Japanese for beginners, as well as practicing reading complex passages for more advanced learners. Whether you're just starting out or you're preparing for the JLPT, join us as we discuss strategies for improving reading comprehension. Hope to see you there!
