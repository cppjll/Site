Conjugations are an essential, but relatively simple, part of Japanese grammar. They're used to change the form of verbs and adjectives to express different meanings. We will be covering the basic concepts of conjugations such as godan and ichidan verbs, as well as conjugating adjectives. Thankfully, unlike English, Japanese conjugations are pretty consistent 😉. We hope to see you there! 🗣️🗣️
