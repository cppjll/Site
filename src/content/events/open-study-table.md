**Open Study Table** is a weekly event hosted by [Leo](https://cpp-jll.com/board#leonard-woo) in the library. As opposed to our regular meetings, this is more casual and less structured. Bring books, manga, or anything else you'd like to study with, and join us for a relaxed study session. Hope to see you there! ðŸ«‚ðŸ“š
