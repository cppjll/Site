Onomatopoeias are words that imitate the natural sounds of things, but in Japanese they are so much more! They can be used to describe feelings, sounds, and actions in a way that is unique to the Japanese language. Whether it's in manga or even daily conversation, you'll see them used everywhere! We'll be discussing the different types of onomatopoeias and how you'll typically see them used in conversations. We look forward to seeing you there! ðŸŽ¶
