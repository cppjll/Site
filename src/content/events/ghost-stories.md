**いちまい、にまい、さんまい…**

What does this mean? Well, join us in the next meeting to find out!
oooo you wanna know so bad what it means, *oooooo curiosity plagues your mind～* 😐

Our next meeting will be in celebration of Halloween. We will be reading several classic Japanese ghost stories like **Okiku and the Nine Plates** to set the mood for a frightful evening! Beginners welcomed! Prepare yourself for Japanese learners' greatest fear: **Old writing.** 😨 We hope to see you there! Have a wonderful weekend.
