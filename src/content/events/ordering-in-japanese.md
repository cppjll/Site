Ordering something from a cafe and a restaurant, although simple, can be daunting when you're unfamiliar with the language. In this meeting, we'll be going over how a typical exchange goes when ordering food or drinks in Japan. We'll then put our knowledge to the test by practicing ordering from a cafe and a restaurant in Japanese. Hope to see you there!
