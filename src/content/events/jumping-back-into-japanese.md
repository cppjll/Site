Starting the learning process for a new language can be daunting, but we're here to help! For those new to Japanese, we'll be going over the basics of Japanese and how to get started with learning the language. If you've been studying Japanese for a while, we'll be working on grammar and vocab exercises to help you get back into the swing of things. Whether you're a returning member or new to the club, we hope to see you there!
