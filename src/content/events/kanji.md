To many, kanji is seen as the most intimidating part of learning Japanese. There are thousands of characters, each with multiple readings and meanings. It's easy to get lost in the sea of characters, but it doesn't have to be that way! In this meeting, we'll be demystifying kanji and discussing a variety of methods to learn it. We'll then be putting our knowledge to the test with a sentence-building activity that's accessible to all levels. We hope to see you there!
