bio: Hello! My name is Alan, I'm a fourth year CS major, and the club's vice president! I've been studying Japanese for a year now, mostly through watching anime and reading books and VN's. I started learning it because I like anime and thought it would be cool to just understand it one day. Some of my favorites are Bloom into You, Bocchi the Rock, and Oddtaxi. Ssome of my hobbies outside of Japanese are coffee and programming. Feel free to reach out if u wanna chat about something!
