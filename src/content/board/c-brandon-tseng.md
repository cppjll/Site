bio: Hello everynyan. My name is Brandon! I am a first year CS major, serving as the club's scheduler. I got into Japanese through Japanese music from artists such as Kessoku Band, Minami, and TUYU. I do not watch anime often, but my favorite show is Bocchi the Rock and my favorite movie is Whisper of the Heart! Some past times I enjoy are video games (ofc), guitar, and rock climbing. Feel free to share your Japanese music recommendations with me! ٩(^ᗜ^ )و
