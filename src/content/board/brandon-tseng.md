bio: Hello everynyan. I am Brandon, a first year CS major and the club's Scheduler! I started learning Japanese towards the end of summer in 2023 because of Japanese music. Since then, I've been "very consistently" studying Japanese...haha. Some artists that I like are Kessoku Band, AKFG, Minami, TUYU, Hoshimachi Suisei, sakanaction, and Galileo Galilei! I also LOVEE Bocchi the Rock!!! At JLL, I hope to help provide a fun space for people to learn Japanese and share their passion for the language with others! ٩(^ᗜ^ )و
