bio: Hello everynyan. My name is Brandon! I am a first year CS major, serving as the club's scheduler. I also maintain the club's Discord server. I got into Japanese mainly through Japanese music from Minami, Kessoku Band, and TUYU! I enjoy video games, guitar, and rock climbing. Feel free to share your Japanese music recommendations with me! ٩(^ᗜ^ )و
