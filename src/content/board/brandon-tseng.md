bio: こんいちは皆さにゃん。Hello Everynyan. My name is Brandon and I am the club's scheduler! I am a first year CS major. I started learning Japanese 4-5ish months ago towards the end of summer break! I haven't been consistently studying when school went into session though, so I'm barely an N5...hehe. I got into learning mainly because of YouTube videos about speaking foreign languages, Japanese music, anime artworks, and Bocchi the Rock! Kanji also drew my interest because I know Mandarin (I am Taiwanese).
