bio: Hello, my name is Taehyuan, a fourth year computer engineering major and the club's event organizer. I've been studying Japanese through anime, Japanese music and shows for almost 17 years but still need practice with reading and writing. Some of my favorite animes are Sword Art Online, Inuyasha, Love Live, just to name a few. Some of my other hobbies include composing music, playing games, and compete in kendo. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to have any discussions about anime or anything else!
