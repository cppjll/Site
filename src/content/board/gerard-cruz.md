bio: Hi! I'm Gerard, and I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering major and the club's treasurer. I've been studying Japanese since high school and I started mainly due to Japanese music and wanting to actually understand it (as well as sing along www). I like Jpop, Vocaloid, and utaites (Mafumafu !!!!!). I also like Vtubers for the same reason (Suisei !!). I am always down for some karaoke too! Other than music, I also like Japanese food, playing games, and technology!
